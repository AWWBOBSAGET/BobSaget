(Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh) 
Whatever happened to predictability. 
The milkman, the paperboy, evening tv? 
How did I get to living here? 
Somebody tell me please! 
This old world's confusing me.

With clouds as mean as you've ever seen 
Ain't a bird who knows your tune. 
Then a little voice inside you Whispers, 
Kid don't sell your dreams, so soon

Chorus: 
Everywhere you look, 
Everywhere you go 
There's a heart 
(There's a heart) 
A hand to hold onto. 
Everywhere you look, 
Everywhere you go 
There's a place, 
Of Somebody who needs you 
Everywhere you look.

When you're lost out there and you're all alone, 
A light is waiting to carry you home. 
Everywhere you look. 
Everywhere you look. 
(Chip-a-dee-ba-ba-dow)

During the first season, another version of the themesong was reportedly used:

(Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh) 
Whatever happened to predictability. 
The milkman, the paperboy, evening tv? 
You miss your old familiar friends 
Waiting just around the bend 
This old world's confusing me.

With clouds as mean as you've ever seen 
Ain't a bird who knows your tune. 
Then a little voice inside you Whispers, 
Kid don't sell your dreams, so soon

Chorus: 
Everywhere you look, 
Everywhere you go 
There's a heart 
(There's a heart) 
A hand to hold onto. 
Everywhere you look, 
Everywhere you go 
There's a place, 
Of Somebody who needs you 
Everywhere you look.

When you're lost out there and you're all alone, 
A light is waiting to carry you home. 
Everywhere you look. 
Everywhere you look. 
(Chip-a-dee-ba-ba-dow)
